Technical Documentation for A* pathfinding

*running with maximise on play turned will likley cause ui issues*


Buttons displayed on the side of the screen can to control the A* demonstration

Start Goal and obstacle buttons will turn mouse click on the tiles into their respective buttons tiles

Start will place the green starting point

Goal will place the red ending point

obstacle will place an obstacle that the algorithm will navigate around (currently this button will place empty spaces but is still treated as an obstacle)

Step by Step with progress the algorithm a step at a time with each press (this can only be seen if show path if toggled)

Go will proceed with the entire algorithm and show the character walking the path generated

reset will clear everything

show path displays the algorithm and final path the character will take




An important note is that this algorithm and tilemap uses "2D Tilemap Extras" package which should be provide in the zip file please make sure it is installed before running
